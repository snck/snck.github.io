During meetings or discussions at work, I often find myself wondering, *"Why do we spend so much time debating such a small issue?"* Meanwhile, larger or more critical topics are often discussed briefly, with minimal input from participants.

Recently, I came across something that might explain this phenomenon: the **[Bicycle-Shed Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)** The term comes from an example where, in a meeting about building a nuclear power plant, more time was spent discussing a relatively minor issue—the design of a bicycle shed—than the power plant itself.

The reason is likely that a bicycle shed is a concept everyone understands, so everyone feels qualified to share their opinions. Left unchecked, such discussions can drag on endlessly. In contrast, the nuclear power plant is a complex, specialized topic that only a few people are equipped to address, resulting in less time spent on it.
